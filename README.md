This repository contains data and code related to the analysis of WTC (Wavelet Transform Coherence) values.

The .sav file includes all calculated WTC values for each participant, behavioral performance data, and questionnaire scores.

The .m files are MATLAB scripts used during the WTC calculation process. Please note that the entire process was not fully automated using code.

Statistical tests were performed using SPSS software, so there is no corresponding code for that part.

The .r file contains R code used to generate group comparison plots.

Due to large file sizes, raw data files are not included here but can be provided upon necessary request.
